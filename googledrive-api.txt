Simple upload
  POST /upload/drive/v2/files?uploadType=media HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.googleapis.com
  Content-Type: image/jpeg
  Content-Length: number_of_bytes_in_file
  Authorization: Bearer your_auth_token
  
  JPEG data

Resumable upload 也要按顺序上传
 Step 1: Start a resumable session 
  POST /upload/drive/v2/files?uploadType=resumable HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.googleapis.com
  Authorization: Bearer your_auth_token
  Content-Length: 38
  Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
  X-Upload-Content-Type: image/jpeg
  X-Upload-Content-Length: 2000000
  
  {
    "title": "My File"
  }
  Note: For an initial resumable update request without metadata, leave the body of the request empty, and set the Content-Length header to 0.
 Step 2: Save the resumable session URI
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Location: https://www.googleapis.com/upload/drive/v2/files?uploadType=resumable&upload_id=xa298sd_sdlkj2
  Content-Length: 0
  The value of the Location header, as shown in the above example response, is the session URI you'll use as the HTTP endpoint for doing the actual file upload or querying the upload status.
 Step 3: Upload the file
  PUT {session_uri} HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.googleapis.com
  Content-Length: 524288
  Content-Type: image/jpeg
  Content-Range: bytes 0-524287/2000000
  
  bytes 0-524288
  每个块（除最后一个）必须是256 KB的倍数
 Resume an interrupted upload
  Query the current status of the upload by issuing an empty PUT request to the upload URI. For this request, the HTTP headers should include a Content-Range header indicating that the current position in the file is unknown.  For example, set the Content-Range to */2000000 if your total file length is 2,000,000. If you don't know the full size of the file, set the Content-Range to */*.
